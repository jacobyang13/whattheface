# Background

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

#### Prevalence
 - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): 1 in 68 children in the United States<sup>1</sup>
 - estimated 50,000 teens with autism become adults (losing school-based autism services) each year<sup>1</sup>
 -

#### Health Disparity
 - Well-documented disparities
in access to diagnostic and early intervention services for
ASD (Ennis-Cole et  al. 2013; Magaña et  al. 2013; Mandell
et  al. 2007) suggest that individuals with ASD who
are otherwise disadvantaged by society—including those
who experience disadvantage related to their race, ethnicity,
culture, socioeconomic status, environment, geography,
sex, or gender identity—may experience even greater disparities
in health status and life expectancy.
 - “biological,
behavioral, sociocultural, and environmental factors
that influence population-level health differences” (Hill et al. 2015)
 - "White children with ASD were more
likely to receive coordinated care and
have access to family-centered care
than non-White children; racial disparities
were not affected by insurance
mandates" (Doshi et al. 2017)
 - "There were significant racial and ethnic disparities in five of six provider interaction quality areas. Children with ASD had poorer provider interaction quality in four of six areas. Racial and ethnic disparities are exacerbated among children with ASD in two of six provider interaction quality areas" (Magaña et al. 2012)
