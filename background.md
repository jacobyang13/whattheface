# Background

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

#### What is ASD?
 > Autism, or autism spectrum disorder, refers to a range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication, as well as by unique strengths and differences. We now know that there is not one autism but many types, caused by different combinations of genetic and environmental influences.

 > The term “spectrum” reflects the wide variation in challenges and strengths possessed by each person with autism.

And more of the DSM5-related diagnostic information, listed as 299.00 (F84.0) A. 1.:

> Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.

#### Outlook / Quality of Life

>... individuals with [Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC)] have broad impairments in both self-referential cognition and empathy.

> Individuals with ASC scored lower across all empathy
measures (Cognitive EQ, Affective EQ, IRI Perspective Taking,
IRI Empathic Concern, ECS, Eyes test; all p,0.05). On the IRI
Fantasy subscale, individuals with ASC were also lower than
controls (t(58) = 2.507, p = 0.015, Cohen’s d = 0.66). However, on
the IRI Personal Distress subscale, individuals with ASC scored
higher (t(58) = 23.195, p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.84). Individuals
with ASC showed no differences on the PSCS (t(58) = 0.561,
p = 0.577, Cohen’s d = 0.15), but did report more alexithymia on
the TAS (t(58) = 25.315, p,0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.40). Among the
TAS subscales, individuals with ASC had more difficulty
identifying and describing their own feelings (DIF, DDF) and also
reported more externally oriented thinking (EOT) (all p,0.001).
Individuals with ASC were also lower in SFA on the Self-Focus
Sentence Completion test (t(58) = 2.136, p = 0.037, Cohen’s
d = 0.56).

#### Prevalence
 - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): 1 in 68 children in the United States<sup>1</sup>
 - estimated 50,000 teens with autism become adults (losing school-based autism services) each year<sup>1</sup>
 -

#### Health Disparity
 - Social Determinants of Health (SDoH): Conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes. [(1) CDC site.](https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/) [(2) apparent original source: Healthy People 2020. Social Determinants of Health.](http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-health)

 - Well-documented disparities
in access to diagnostic and early intervention services for
ASD (Ennis-Cole et  al. 2013; Magaña et  al. 2013; Mandell
et  al. 2007) suggest that individuals with ASD who
are otherwise disadvantaged by society—including those
who experience disadvantage related to their race, ethnicity,
culture, socioeconomic status, environment, geography,
sex, or gender identity—may experience even greater disparities
in health status and life expectancy.
 - “biological,
behavioral, sociocultural, and environmental factors
that influence population-level health differences” (Hill et al. 2015)
 - "White children with ASD were more
likely to receive coordinated care and
have access to family-centered care
than non-White children; racial disparities
were not affected by insurance
mandates" (Doshi et al. 2017)
 - "There were significant racial and ethnic disparities in five of six provider interaction quality areas. Children with ASD had poorer provider interaction quality in four of six areas. Racial and ethnic disparities are exacerbated among children with ASD in two of six provider interaction quality areas" (Magaña et al. 2012)
